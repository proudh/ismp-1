And once you get to your highest level, then you have to be unselfish. Stay reachable. Stay in touch. Don’t isolate.</p><p>Jordan has been a sports fan for as long as he can remember, and while in high school, he also liked playing football and baseball. However, basketball remained the one sport that he dedicated his entire career to.</p><p>The 6-foot-6 player became a legend not only because he is the best at what he does, but because his attitude towards achieving success is incredibly motivating and contagious. Jordan understood that failure is part of the success – no matter how many shots he might’ve missed, at the end of the day, he’s still an absolute champion.</p><i>One day, you might look up and see me playing the game at 50. Don’t laugh. Never say never, because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.</i>',

    blurb:
      "<p>Nitpickers continue to point to Steph Curry's lack of an NBA Finals MVP award as some sort of indictment on his historical greatness. It's an asinine argument to make, and one made even less valid when you consider he actually deserved to win the one that went to Andre Iguodala in 2015.</p><p>Still, the haters repeat the irrelevant refrain to the point that there is a major disconnect between how Curry has performed in the Finals and how those performances are remembered. They'd have you believe he has come up short time and again, bailed out by his teammates in the biggest moments.</p>",
